<!-- About the Project -->
## üåü About the Project

<!-- Features -->
### üéØ Features

- Strongly typed POCOs for the following platforms:
  - Discord Webhook API
  - Slack Block Kit SDK
  - Microsoft Teams Message Card
- Compile-time checks for missing properties
- Type safety ensuring correct payload structure
- Leveraging existing platform SDKs and standards

<!-- Why use Hooki? -->
### ü™ù Why use Hooki?

Hooki is a powerful .NET library designed to simplify the creation of webhook payloads for popular platforms like Discord, Slack, and Microsoft Teams. It provides a set of strongly-typed C# POCO classes that serve as building blocks, allowing developers to easily construct and serialize webhook payloads into JSON format.

**Main Benefits:**
- **Simplified Development:** Pre-built POCOs for common webhook JSON payloads across various platforms.
- **Type Safety:** Strongly-typed classes ensure compile-time checks and prevent runtime errors.
- **Clean Code:** Eliminates the need for anonymous objects and inline JSON strings.
- **Focus on Content:** Concentrate on your payload's data and style rather than low-level JSON structure.
- **Flexibility:** Easily extensible for custom webhook requirements while maintaining type safety.

                        new DiscordEmbedField { Name = "Organization Name", Value = "Test Organization", Inline = true },
                        new DiscordEmbedField { Name = "Project Name", Value = "Test Project", Inline = true },

                        new DiscordEmbedField { Name = "Triggered At", Value = DateTimeOffset.UtcNow.ToString("f"), Inline = true },
                        new DiscordEmbedField { Name = "Resolved At", Value = DateTimeOffset.UtcNow.ToString("f"), Inline = true }
                    }
                }
            }
        };
    }

    public async Task SendWebhookAsync(string webhookUrl, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        try
        {
            var discordPayload = CreateDiscordPayload();
            var jsonString = discordPayload.Serialize();

            using var client = _httpClientFactory.CreateClient();
            var content = new StringContent(jsonString, Encoding.UTF8, "application/json");

            var response = await client.PostAsync(webhookUrl, content, cancellationToken);
            response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();

            _logger.LogInformation($"Successfully posted a Discord message to the webhook URL: {webhookUrl}");
        }
        catch (HttpRequestException ex)
        {
            _logger.LogError(ex, $"Failed to post Discord message to webhook URL: {webhookUrl}");
            throw;
        }
    }
}

// Example usage
public class ExampleController
{
    private readonly DiscordWebhookService _discordWebhookService;

    public ExampleController(DiscordWebhookService discordWebhookService)
    {
        _discordWebhookService = discordWebhookService;
    }

    public async Task SendDiscordNotification()
    {
        string webhookUrl = "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/your-webhook-url-here";
        await _discordWebhookService.SendWebhookAsync(webhookUrl, CancellationToken.None);
    }
}
```

Please make sure to use the extension available on the `DiscordWebhookPayload`, `MsTeamsWebhookPayload` and `SlackWebhookPayload` classes to serialize the payload into JSON using Hooki's settings for convenience and consistency.

```csharp
// Build your payload with what you want to send
var payload = new MsTeamsWebhookPayload();

// Serialize your payload into JSON ready to send
var jsonString = payload.Serialize();
```

<!-- Roadmap -->
## üß≠ Roadmap

* [x] POCOs
* [x] Implement Unit Tests
* [x] Provide builders utilising fluent api to reduce boilerplate code when creating webhook payloads
* [ ] Support Files and Polls in Discord Webhook
* [ ] Implement type safety POCOs for Discord message components
* [ ] Introduce Validation to provide a better developer experience (Apps are not returning error details for 400s)
* [ ] Remove the use of objects in numerous places and replace with a clean union type solution for type safety and readability
* [ ] Support other languages?
